This Jupyter Notebook repository offers a comprehensive analysis of exoplanet data. It begins with data loading and visualization, showcasing scatter plots to highlight connections between planet radius/star radius and planet mass/star mass. It then calculates Pearson correlation coefficients to quantify these relationships.

The repository delves into machine learning with a linear regression model. It utilizes PyTorch and scikit-learn for data preprocessing and modeling. The data is cleaned, split into training/testing sets, and standardized. A linear regression model is defined, trained with SGD, and evaluated with MSE loss. The progression of training is documented, and the model's predictions are visualized against the original data points.

This resource is valuable for data scientists, astronomers, and anyone interested in the fascinating world of exoplanets.
